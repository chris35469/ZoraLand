## Game
ZoraLand combines the Zora Development Kit (ZDK) with the Phaser 3 game engine. TypeScript and node was used to build the final product. The game allows users to move around using the cursor keys and WASD. It features a main character and multiple envelopes. When the player collides with an envelope they may discover Zora tokens. When Zora tokens are discovered the title of the token and media is displayed. Players then have the option to view the collection on Zora by pressing V or Minting a ZoraLand token by pressing M. The token data displayed is acquired by calling the ZDK token query.
